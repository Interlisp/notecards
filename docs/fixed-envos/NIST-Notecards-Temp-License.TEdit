Any such notice shall state the new location of the CPU or the model number, serial number and location of the subsequent CPU.b.  Once installed on a CPU, the Licensed Software may be used on that CPU by only one user at a time.c.  Other than by installing it on a CPU, Licensee may copy the Licensed Software, in whole or in part, only twice, and only for backup or archive purposes.  Each copy shall include in readable format any and all proprietary and copyright notices or markings contained on the Licensed Software provided by ENVOS.d.

Licensee shall not permit anyone to use any portion of the Licensed Software (i) for the purpose of decompiling or otherwise deriving its source code or (ii) for purposes other than as authorized in this Agreement.e.  Licensee may modify the Licensed Software and may merge it with other software only for its own use and only with a CPU.f.  Licensee may develop applications and programs using the Licensed Software and such applications and programs shall be the property of Licensee. Licensee may distribute only those applications or programs that do not include any portion of the Licensed Software or any language translation thereof.5.  TERMINATION OF SOFTWARE LICENSEa.  This Software License shall terminate:  (i) on March 1, 1991 or (ii) on fifteen (15) days' prior notice by ENVOS if there is any default or breach by Licensee of any provision of this Agreement; or (iii) immediately, upon notice by ENVOS pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7b hereof.b.

ENVOS warrants that it has the right to grant a license to use the Licensed Software to Licensee and, further, that ENVOS has the right and power to enter into this Agreement.b.  ENVOS makes no warranty whatsoever of the Licensed Software for the purposes of this Temporary Software License Agreement.  Licensee accepts the Licensed Software ªas isº. c.  ENVOS HEREBY DISCLAIMS, AND LICENSEE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES, ANY AND ALL EXPRESS WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, AND ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  LICENSEE AND ENVOS AGREE THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ªCONSUMER GOODSº FOR THE PURPOSES OF FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS.d.

PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNIFICATIONSa.  ENVOS agrees, at its own expense, to defend Licensee in any suit, claim or proceeding brought against Licensee alleging that Licensed Software infringes a United States patent and/or a United States copyright, or violates a domestic trade secret right of a third party, provided that Licensee (i) promptly notifies ENVOS in writing of such suit, claim, or proceeding, (ii) gives ENVOS full information and assistance required to defend such suit, claim or proceeding, (iii) allows ENVOS  to direct the defense of such suit, claim or proceeding, and (iv) allows ENVOS to pay any judgment of a court of last resort; provided, however, that ENVOS shall have no liability for settlements or costs incurred without its consent; and provided, further, that ENVOS shall have no liability to Licensee in any suit, claim or proceeding brought against Licensee in which and to the extent that (i) the alleged infringement arises from any modification of the Licensed Software as originally supplied by ENVOS or from the use of other software with the Licensed Software, and (ii) the claim for such infringement would have been avoided if such other software had not been used.b.  If Licensee's use of Licensed Software is enjoined, or if ENVOS desires to minimize its liabilities hereunder, ENVOS will have the right, at its sole option, either to substitute other equally suitable software, to modify the Licensed Software so that it no longer infringes or to obtain for Licensee the right to continue its use.  If, in ENVOS's sole opinion, none of the foregoing is reasonably possible, then ENVOS may terminate this License immediately upon notice to Licensee.  Upon such termination Licensee shall satisfy the provisions set forth in Paragraph 5b above.c.  THE OBLIGATION OF ENVOS UNDER THIS SECTION 7 SHALL BE THE SOLE LIABILITY OF ENVOS TO LICENSEE IF THERE IS ANY SUIT, CLAIM, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT AGAINST LICENSEE ALLEGING THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE INFRINGES ANY PATENT AND/OR A COPYRIGHT, OR VIOLATES ANY TRADE SECRET RIGHT OF A THIRD PARTY.  ALL OTHER LIABILITIES OR OBLIGATIONS OF ENVOS FOR DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED.8.  NO TRANSFER OF TITLENo transfer of title to the Licensed Software is effected by this Agreement. Licensee shall retain possession and control of all copies of the Licensed Software at all times.  Licensee shall not make the Licensed Software available to any third party for any purpose.9.  ENTIRE AGREEMENTThis Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all proposals or prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings of the parties regarding such matter.  Terms and conditions contained in any Licensee purchase order or other ordering document submitted pursuant hereto shall have no binding effect on ENVOS and will not modify this Agreement in any way.10.  MISCELLANEOUSa.  No delay or failure of either party to exercise any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement for a particular situation shall be deemed or constitute a permanent waiver of such provision for any other situation nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver for the same situation if it should reoccur.b.

Licensee acknowledges that its rights in and to the Licensed Software may not be assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of ENVOS.d.

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions which can be given effect without the invalid provision.g.  The prevailing party in any proceeding to resolve a dispute pertaining to matters covered by this Agreement shall be entitled to receive its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such proceeding, in addition to any other relief it may be awarded.h.
