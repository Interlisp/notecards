This repo contains a version of NoteCards 2.0,  

The source was obtained from Arun Welch in May 2021.  It is close but not 100% identical to the
source contained in the envos repo: envos/RELEASE/notecards/2.0/src.

As of 2021-06-12, the BASIC functionality runs OK on the latest Medley full sysout
dated 2021-04-30.  Known exception is Browser cards, which can be created and saved but
break when subsequently reopened.  None of the library files have yet been tested to see if 
they work on the lastest full sysout.
